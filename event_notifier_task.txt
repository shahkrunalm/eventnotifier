Hibernate ORM tool
-> 1st level caching
-> automatic creation of table due to hbm.ddl.auto configuration in hibernate.cfg.xml file
-> Relationship managed through POJO classes
-> no need to add/remove column manually
DAO design pattern
-> controller, service and dao classes
-> Minimal changes in dao layer only if there is a change in database
-> loosely couple code
-> controller class - for controlling
-> service class - for business logic
-> dao class - database related operation
DRY pattern
-> Don't repeat yourself
git version control system
-> distributed
-> in case of failure, master copy in git
-> no manual editing, no merge conflict
Logger implement
-> which package used for logging
-> logger level
-> error will be immediately indetified due to logging
